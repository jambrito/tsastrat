 This package provides, in the tsatrat function, 
  an algorithm that performs the stratification of a population defined by 
  a vector X (with N observations), considering the minimization of the variance of 
  the total estimator of X. The algorithm combines concepts of metaheuristic tabu search 
  and an exact sample allocation method.
